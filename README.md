Wanna know about me in-depth...<br>
***[It's not all about Christo John but about Tesnic as well]***<br><br>
***Hello*** **Boss,**

       Wanna know about me... Then you are at the right place...<br>
My name is Christo John, from the land of kerala - **The Gods Own country**....<br>
Aged 18 as on may 12 2022... And a BCA student...<br>

I am a computer aspirant and programmer along with basic IoT, Arduino and NodeMCU development...<br>
It was my biggest dream to learn about hardware and software technologies to its root...<br>

# 💫 Interests

I am interested in a lot of stuffs but yet not defined them all properly but surely am intersted in the field of Computer Technology - both Hardware and software -...<br>
Also am interested in the field of agriculture as I am rooted to an agricultural family. All my predecessors from my father to great grandparents great grand parents were all farmers...<br>
Along with that I am very much fond of anime, manga and of course manga novels 😅😅...<br>


#💭 Dreams

As same as my Interests has a lot of undefined dreams. ***Currently my dream is to become a computer expert where I am capable of defining a computer upto its roof to root and could understand it completely both in terms of Hardware and software technologies - pretty fancy... isn't it 😂😂-***<br>
As for my biggest dream, ***It is to create a completely free  and open-source world where anyone could find anything which they are interested in learning and learn it fir free as well as get hands-on-experience including practical experience absolutely free *-Well, that seems super fancy and impossible... But it's not yet...-*<br>


# 💥 Programmer | Designer | Developer

Well, I would introduce myself as a programmer, designer and a developer. Its because I am...<br>

> 🧾 As a programmer,<br>
I am capable of handling mid level C as well as basic level java and some node.js in terms of software programming...<br>
In terms of hardware programming I am pretty much capable of handling Arduino, NodeMCU development boards and could handle some basic level IoT projects...<br>

> 👨‍💻 As a designer,<br>
Well as a designer I am capable of handling some graphic designing softwares as well as typographic designing (primarily fontLab and fontForge)<br>
And as well as I could design some no code websites.. Well of course I have a website for real as well as a website is being under designing for my brand name **TESNIC** and soon will be released for real...!<br>

> 📀 As a developer<br>
Aand of course as a developer I could handle Arduino, NodeMCU, IoT projects development and as well as am currently a telegram bot designer and developer....<br>
Yes of course I am a telegram bot develooer...**TESNICO** is my primary bot's name -Which was of course derived from **Tesnic**... Tesnico is currently 7under development as of 10 04 2023(today) and am not 24/7 online... It is locally hosted and not in any clouds.... But Tesnico's source code and files are publically available at my Tesnico repo...<br>

# 🦸‍♀️🦸‍♂️🧛‍♂️Role model<br>

If you ask who my role model is, then I'll definitely say it is **NIKOLA TESLA**!, and why is that....<br>
Well Nokola Tesla is the biggest scientist who had made 100's N 1000's of inventions, yet unrecognized... He was the biggest man who had always dedicated his whole for research and invention.. He was the man whose 68% inventions were used world wide... And he is the man who revolutionized the world with his AC current tech.. And who is there more worthy to be a role model✨️. <br> 



So basically that's all about me.... But well,of course its not all about me but about TESNIC as well...<br>
So what is TESNIC any way....<br>

# ⭕️ TESNIC

Tesnic is something more complex!but not either... It is just a simple name under I am releasing my projects activities and whatever I am releasing publically... It's almost like my brand name... Or a pen name... It represents myself and only me...<br>
Now then, where did Tesnic came from...<br>

Well, TesNic has  two parts as you see.. Tes and Nic... **Tes** as in **Tesla** and **Nic** as in **Nikola**... Yes of course TesNic is derived from **Nikola Tesla**....<br>
Why wasn't it NicTes then!  It's because I am a fan of japaneese... And in Japanese they say second name or initial or family name -whatever it is- as first name.. And thus Nikola Tesla became Tesla Nikola and thus TesNic...<br>


What all do I have under Tesnic currently... Well currently only Tesnico is under the flag Tesnic.. And am working on a blog site which will soon be released for real names *TechNic* Which is derived from tech+Tesnic words...<br>
